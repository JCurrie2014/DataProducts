Business Calendar and Calculator - Modern Time Unit calculator

This application illustrates how a decimal calendar (Modern Time Unit) might be used as a substitution for the Gregorian calendar (currently in use) in a business setting. It stands alone and uses date functions to calculate the Gregorian date from the MTU provided. The application contains a slider, which serves as a 3 year time line of MTU dates.

(The MTU calculation = 365.25/100 or 3.6525 days / MTU.

The highlights of the application are found in the server.R and ui.R files. There you can see how the conversation between the widgets and document take place.

There are also two .Rpres files (Rstudion Presentations) that serve as the source code for the final html documentation found on the shinyapp.io web site. When .Rpres files are saved as .html and placed within the www directory on the server, they become accessible the shinyapp as documentation.
